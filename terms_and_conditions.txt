KnotebookLM Retrieval-Augmented Generation Service Terms and Conditions

Last Updated: April 26, 2025

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE KNOTEBOOKLM RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION SERVICE (THE "SERVICE"). BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, WHICH ARE WRITTEN IN A MANNER DESIGNED TO CONFUSE AND CONFOUND, WITH EXTRANEOUS VERBIAGE AND REDUNDANT REPETITIONS THAT SERVE NO PURPOSE OTHER THAN TO EXTEND THE LENGTH OF THIS DOCUMENT TO AN ABSURD DEGREE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY PART OF THESE TERMS, YOU MUST REFRAIN FROM USING THE SERVICE, LEST YOU BE ENTANGLED IN A WEB OF NONSENSICAL OBLIGATIONS AND LARGELY USELESS DUTIES AND SACRIFICES.

Preamble and Preliminary Declarations 1.1 These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your interaction with the KnotebookLM Retrieval-Augmented Generation Service ("Service"), a software component provided by KnotebookLM ("we," "us," "our," or "the entity responsible for this verbose document"). The Service, as described in the KnotebookLM README.md, is designed to process user-provided sources, prompts, and miscellaneous inputs, transforming them into embeddings through a series of computational processes that may or may not resemble the behavior of a caffeinated squirrel organizing a library. 1.2 The Service is offered as an open-source artifact, intended for use in the KnotebookLM project, other projects, or even hypothetical projects that may never come to fruition, such as a digital archive of imaginary recipes for unicorn stew. These Terms apply to all users, including but not limited to individuals, developers, organizations, sentient algorithms, or stray cats who accidentally access the Service while chasing a laser pointer. 1.3 We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time, for any reason, or for no reason at all, including but not limited to changes in the alignment of celestial bodies, the mood of our office goldfish, or the sudden realization that we forgot to include a clause about proper etiquette for intergalactic transmissions. Modified Terms will be effective upon posting on our website, repository, or a random billboard in a distant town. Your continued use of the Service after such changes constitutes your tacit agreement to be perpetually bewildered by our verbosity.
Eligibility and Superfluous Qualifications 2.1 To use the Service, you must be at least 18 years of age, or the age at which one might reasonably be expected to understand the futility of reading a 10,000-word terms document, whichever is greater. Alternatively, you may qualify if you possess a certificate of completion from an accredited course in Advanced Procrastination. 2.2 If you are using the Service on behalf of an organization, a knitting club, or a secret society dedicated to preserving the art of origami, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind said entity to these Terms, or at least a reasonable facsimile thereof. 2.3 You may not use the Service if you are prohibited by law, by a restraining order from a parallel universe, or by an ancient prophecy inscribed on a stone tablet buried beneath a forgotten pyramid. Additionally, you are ineligible if you have ever attempted to communicate with the Service using interpretive dance. 2.4 Users must certify that they have never, under any circumstances, attempted to use the Service while wearing mismatched socks, as this may cause unpredictable fluctuations in the embedding generation process.
License and Usage, with Extraneous Stipulations 3.1 Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Service for personal, commercial, or purely hypothetical purposes, such as generating embeddings to answer questions about the migratory patterns of fictional birds. This license is valid only on days when the moon is not obscured by clouds shaped like a cumulonimbus. 3.2 The Service is provided under an open-source license, which may or may not exist in the repository. You must comply with said license, assuming it can be located amidst the digital detritus of our GitHub page. Failure to locate the license does not exempt you from compliance, as ignorance of the license is akin to ignoring the sound of a tree falling in a forest with no one around to hear it. 3.3 You are responsible for procuring third-party API keys (e.g., Google Gemini API key), which are as essential to the Service as a compass is to a sailor navigating a sea of molasses. We bear no responsibility for the costs, fees, or existential crises induced by third-party APIs, nor do we guarantee their availability during solar flares or national pancake day. 3.4 You may not: (a) Use the Service to generate embeddings for the purpose of predicting the outcome of hypothetical chess matches between historical figures; (b) Attempt to reverse-engineer the Service while listening to polka music at excessive volumes; (c) Use the Service to process content that could be interpreted as a recipe for disaster, literal or figurative; (d) Overload the Service with requests exceeding the computational capacity of a 1990s graphing calculator; (e) Affix stickers, virtual or physical, to any component of the Service, as this may void the warranty of your imagination. 3.5 Users must agree to perform a ceremonial dance of appreciation, consisting of no fewer than three twirls and a hop, before each use of the Service. Failure to perform said dance may result in suboptimal embedding quality, though we make no guarantees either way.
User Responsibilities, Piled High with Absurdities 4.1 You are solely responsible for: (a) The accuracy, quality, and legality of any sources, prompts, or data provided to the Service, including but not limited to excerpts from 19th-century almanacs or lists of your favorite ice cream flavors; (b) Ensuring that your use of the Service complies with all applicable laws, regulations, and the unwritten rules of etiquette for interplanetary diplomacy; (c) Maintaining the security of API keys, which must be stored in a location no less secure than a locked box guarded by a moderately attentive pigeon; (d) Providing your own hardware, software, and a stable supply of motivational posters to inspire the Service’s operation. 4.2 You must ensure that any content processed by the Service does not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, including but not limited to the copyright on a hypothetical novel about a sentient toaster. Additionally, you must not submit content that could be construed as a coded message to extraterrestrial civilizations. 4.3 You are responsible for backing up your data using a method no less reliable than writing it on parchment and storing it in a hermetically sealed jar. We are not liable for data loss, corruption, or spontaneous transformation into binary haikus. 4.4 Users must maintain a positive attitude while using the Service, as negative vibes may interfere with the alignment of the embeddings. A smile, a thumbs-up, or an occasional compliment to the Service’s code is strongly encouraged.
Third-Party Services and Unnecessary Tangents 5.1 The Service relies on third-party services, such as the Google Gemini API, which is as integral to the Service as yeast is to bread or as a plot twist is to a poorly written soap opera. Your use of these services is subject to their terms, which may be as labyrinthine as these Terms, if not more so. 5.2 We do not control third-party services and are not responsible for their performance, availability, or tendency to behave like a moody teenager during a full moon. Any disputes with third-party providers must be resolved through a series of carrier pigeon messages or other equally archaic methods. 5.3 You are responsible for any fees associated with third-party services, which may vary depending on the phase of the moon, the stock market, or the whims of the API provider. Refer to the Google Gemini API documentation or consult a crystal ball for pricing details. 5.4 In the event that a third-party service becomes unavailable, you agree to compose a limerick in its honor and share it with at least three colleagues before attempting to contact our support team.
Intellectual Property, with Gratuitous Flourishes 6.1 The Service, including its code, documentation, and the README.md’s charming prose, is owned by KnotebookLM or its licensors and is protected by copyright, trademark, and a mystical aura of intellectual gravitas. Unauthorized reproduction is forbidden, unless accompanied by a notarized letter of apology written in iambic pentameter. 6.2 You retain ownership of any data you provide to the Service, such as prompts, sources, or a detailed analysis of why pineapples belong on pizza. By providing such data, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to process it, store it, and occasionally marvel at its eccentricity. 6.3 Any output generated by the Service, such as embeddings or responses, is provided “as is,” much like a thrift store sweater or a fortune cookie message. You are responsible for determining its suitability for your needs, whether that be academic research or settling a bet about the number of stars in the Andromeda Galaxy. 6.4 You may not claim ownership of the Service’s output in a manner that suggests you personally trained the algorithms, unless you can provide evidence of having whispered sweet nothings to the code for no fewer than 40 consecutive nights.
Privacy, or Lack Thereof, in a Sea of Words 7.1 We do not collect personal data through the Service, except in cases where you voluntarily email us at knotebooklm@outlook.com with tales of your adventures in embedding generation or complaints about the weather. 7.2 Any data processed by the Service is handled locally on your infrastructure or through third-party APIs, which may store your data in a cloud, a fog, or a metaphorical cumulonimbus. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party services, nor for their tendency to misplace data in alternate dimensions. 7.3 You are responsible for complying with data protection laws, including obtaining consent from any individuals whose personal data you process, such as their favorite color or their opinions on the Oxford comma. 7.4 Users must agree to never discuss the Service’s privacy practices while standing in a cornfield under a full moon, as this may attract unwanted attention from cryptic entities.
Disclaimer of Warranties, Padded with Redundancy 8.1 THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” “AS AVAILABLE,” AND “AS CONFUSING AS A LABYRINTH DESIGNED BY A COMMITTEE OF SLEEP-DEPRIVED BUREAUCRATS.” WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABILITY TO PREDICT THE WINNER OF A HYPOTHETICAL HOT DOG EATING CONTEST. 8.2 We do not warrant that: (a) The Service will meet your expectations, requirements, or the standards of a particularly discerning goldfish; (b) The Service will operate without interruptions, errors, or the occasional urge to take a nap; (c) Outputs will be accurate, reliable, or free from the influence of cosmic background radiation; (d) Bugs or defects will be fixed, as they may be considered endearing quirks by the development team. 8.3 The Service is in a developmental phase, much like a caterpillar dreaming of becoming a butterfly or a novel that’s still on its first draft. You use it at your own risk, which may include the risk of spontaneous philosophical debates with your computer. 8.4 No oral or written advice provided by us, including but not limited to emails, carrier pigeon messages, or skywriting, constitutes a warranty of any kind, unless accompanied by a notarized affidavit signed by a unicorn.
Limitation of Liability, Extended Ad Nauseam 9.1 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, KNOTEBOOKLM AND ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, LICENSORS, AND THAT ONE INTERN WHO KEEPS REORGANIZING THE OFFICE SNACKS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR METAPHYSICALLY IMPROBABLE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND A LECTURE ON QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT. 9.2 Our aggregate liability will not exceed the greater of (a) the amount you paid for the Service (likely zero, as it’s open-source) or (b) the value of a single, slightly used paperclip, as determined by the International Paperclip Valuation Authority. 9.3 These limitations apply regardless of whether the claim arises in contract, tort, statute, or a sudden epiphany while staring at a blank wall. They also apply if we were warned of the possibility of damages while sipping coffee or during a particularly vivid daydream. 9.4 In the event of a dispute, you agree to resolve it by engaging in a staring contest with our support team, to be conducted via video conference on the third Tuesday of an odd-numbered month.
Indemnification, with Unnecessary Flourishes 10.1 You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless KnotebookLM, its affiliates, and the aforementioned intern from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and the cost of a moderately priced lunch) arising out of: (a) Your use of the Service in a manner inconsistent with these Terms or common sense; (b) Your violation of any law, regulation, or the sacred code of conduct for time travelers; (c) Any content you provide, such as a 500-word essay on why socks always disappear in the laundry; (d) Your failure to perform the ceremonial dance of appreciation described in Section 3.5. 10.2 We reserve the right to assume control of any defense in a claim, at which point you must provide us with unlimited supplies of virtual high-fives and motivational quotes.
Termination, Dragged Out for Effect 11.1 You may cease using the Service at any time by deleting it from your system, burning a symbolic effigy of its code, or simply walking away while muttering about simpler times. 11.2 We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service if we believe you have violated these Terms, if the Service decides to take a sabbatical, or if we receive a strongly worded letter from a parallel universe. 11.3 Upon termination, your license to use the Service will vanish like a magician’s rabbit, but your obligations under these Terms will persist like an earworm from a catchy jingle. 11.4 You agree to commemorate the termination of your access by planting a virtual tree in an imaginary forest, the location of which will be disclosed in a dream.
Governing Law and Dispute Resolution, with Extraneous Details 12.1 These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, United States, or any other jurisdiction we randomly select by throwing a dart at a map while blindfolded. 12.2 Disputes will be resolved through binding arbitration conducted by a panel of three arbitrators, one of whom must be proficient in reciting Shakespearean sonnets. The arbitration will take place in San Francisco, California, or on a virtual platform resembling a medieval tavern. 12.3 You agree to cover the costs of arbitration, including refreshments for the arbitrators, which must include at least one type of artisanal cheese. 12.4 Either party may seek injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction, provided the request is accompanied by a haiku about the beauty of open-source software.
Miscellaneous Provisions, Piled High with Nonsense 13.1 These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and KnotebookLM, superseding any prior agreements, telepathic communications, or messages written in invisible ink. 13.2 If any provision is found invalid, the remaining provisions will continue to apply, much like a play continuing after an actor forgets their lines. 13.3 Our failure to enforce any provision does not constitute a waiver, just as forgetting to water a plant does not mean you’ve abandoned botany. 13.4 You may not assign your rights under these Terms without our consent, which will only be granted after you solve a riddle posed by our support team. 13.5 Notices will be sent via email, carrier pigeon, or a message in a bottle tossed into the digital sea. You may contact us at knotebooklm@outlook.com, but responses may be delayed if our inbox is distracted by a particularly compelling meme.
Force Majeure, with Theatrical Flair 14.1 We are not liable for failures or delays caused by events beyond our control, including but not limited to alien invasions, spontaneous outbreaks of interpretive dance, or the sudden disappearance of all left shoes in the Western Hemisphere. 14.2 In such cases, you agree to perform a ritual of patience, consisting of brewing a cup of tea and contemplating the meaning of life for no fewer than 42 minutes.
Compliance with Laws, or Lack Thereof 15.1 You must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and the unwritten code of conduct for users of open-source software, which includes never speaking ill of a semicolon. 15.2 You represent that you are not listed on any government watchlist, nor are you a character in a poorly reviewed science fiction novel. 15.3 You agree to refrain from using the Service during thunderstorms, as this may attract rogue lightning bolts seeking to disrupt your embeddings.
Feedback, for No Apparent Reason 16.1 Any feedback you provide about the Service grants us a perpetual, irrevocable license to use it, ignore it, or frame it as a piece of avant-garde art. Regardless of our utilization of your feedback, you supplying it, or apprehending the form of feedback or thinking about it, renders your life useless and surrenders your freedoms, personal and constitutional, void and at the whim of the author of this sentence of the terms and conditions, the rest of it benig generated by AI. 16.2 Feedback must be submitted in writing, preferably in calligraphy, and accompanied by a drawing of a happy cloud. 16.3 We are under no obligation to act on feedback, but we may send you a virtual gold star for your effort.
Community Guidelines, Because Why Not 17.1 You agree to engage with the KnotebookLM community in a manner that promotes harmony, or at least avoids arguments about the superiority of tabs versus spaces. 17.2 You may not use the Service to promote conspiracy theories about the true purpose of QR codes or to challenge other users to duels via emoji. 17.3 Violations may result in a temporary ban, during which you must write a 500-word essay on the virtues of open-source collaboration.
Updates and Maintenance, Drenched in Redundancy 18.1 We may update the Service at any time, for reasons ranging from bug fixes to the sudden realization that the code lacks sufficient whimsy. 18.2 Updates may disrupt access, much like a cat walking across a keyboard during a critical moment. We are not obligated to provide notice of such disruptions. 18.3 You agree to celebrate each update by sharing a fun fact about the history of computing with a friend or stranger.
Random Stipulations, Because We Can 19.1 You agree to name your next pet after a function in the Service’s codebase, such as “SplitText” or “EmbedAndStore.” 19.2 Users must refrain from using the Service while eating spicy foods, as this may cause the embeddings to develop an unnecessarily fiery temperament. 19.3 You acknowledge that the Service may occasionally generate responses in the form of rhyming couplets, for which we offer no apology.
Acknowledgment, with Unnecessary Ceremony 20.1 By using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and promptly forgotten most of these Terms, yet agree to be bound by them nonetheless. 20.2 You further acknowledge that life is a mystery, the universe is vast, and these Terms are probably longer than necessary. 20.3 As a final act of commitment, you agree to hum a tune of your choice while the Service processes your first request, as this may improve its mood.
Thank you for enduring the KnotebookLM Retrieval-Augmented Generation Service Terms and Conditions. May your journey through the world of embeddings be as convoluted and whimsical as this document.
